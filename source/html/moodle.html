<h1>What is a Moodle?</h1>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://moodle.org/about/">Moodle</a> is a &quot;learning management system,&quot; a phrase used to refer to a class of software  &quot;for the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting and delivery of e-learning education courses or training programs.&quot; <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Institutions rely on Moodle to fulfill different functions. At Chelsea School, we rely on Moodle to augment on-campus courses or to provide hybrid courses.</p>
<p>Moodle is accessible via the Web at the following address: <a class="reference external" href="http://chelseapride.org">http://chelseapride.org</a> - note the address does not begin with <em>www</em>.</p>
<p>Chelsea School's Moodle works best with Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, and Safari.</p>

<h1>Front Page (Main Conent Area)</h1>
<p>We've made a significant effort to make Moodle's front page more accessible to more students.</p>
<p>In the past, students have been faced with a wall of text listing courses and course catalogs. Beginning this year, the main part of the Front Page begins with a more visual experience; the verbal components are still on the front page, but are now subordinate to the icon-driven experience.</p>
<p>Icons appear in three groups: Quicklinks for students, quicklinks for parents and guardians, and finally course categories.</p>
<div class="section" id="links-for-students">
<h2>Links for Students</h2>
<p>In addition to a quicklink to course icons, students will find links for accessing other resources, such as their school E-mail accounts, Khan Academy, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="links-for-parents-and-guardians">
<h2>Links for Parents and Guardians</h2>
<p>This section includes links to PowerSchool, the student handbook, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="academic-departments">
<h2>Academic Departments</h2>
<p>We've limited the amount of text the user has to cut through by linking directly to course departments: Science, Technology, English/Language Arts, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="courses-by-category">
<h2>Courses by Category</h2>
<p>Wall of text. More direct path to courses, but not the best way to serve many in our community.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="front-page-left-sidebar">
<h1>Front Page (Left Sidebar)</h1>
<div class="section" id="logging-in-students-only">
<h2>Logging In (Students Only)</h2>
<p>To the immediate left of the front page content area is a sidebar for navigation. It is divided into blocks. The top block is for logging in to Moodle.</p>
<p>Logging in requires a username and complex password. Both are provided by a student's advisor and cannot be changed by the student. The pattern for student usernames is &lt;lastname&gt;&lt;first initial&gt; (all lower case). To log in, enter the username in the username field and the password into the password field; press enter or click <em>Login</em> to submit credentials.</p>
<p>Forgotten passwords can be recovered by advisors and their colleagues. However, students who get stuck logging in to Moodle from home can contact <a class="reference external" href="http://chelseapride.org/helpdesk">helpdesk</a> at <a class="reference external" href="http://chelseapride.org/helpdesk">http://chelseapride.org/helpdesk</a>.</p>
<p>There are icons for helpdesk in both the Student's section of the front page and the Parents' and Guardians' section of the front page.</p>
<p>After a brief wait, successful login will be indicated at the top right of the page, which should indicate that the student is the logged in user.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="parent-guardian-access">
<h1>Parent &amp; Guardian Access</h1>
<p>Parents and guardians are discouraged from logging in to student accounts; we understand, however, that in some cases it can be helpful.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we've configured all available courses to be either:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Available to the public; or</li>
<li>Available with a passcode.</li>
</ol>
<p>At Chelsea School, restricted courses have been configured to provide guest access to guests with a course passcode.</p>
<p>The passcode with which parents and guardians can access all restricted courses is <strong>chelseaguest</strong>.</p>
<p>To access a course as a guest,</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Navigate to the desired course;</li>
<li>Click on &quot;Login as Guest;&quot;</li>
<li>Enter &quot;Guest Access Password&quot; and click &quot;Submit.&quot;</li>
</ol>
