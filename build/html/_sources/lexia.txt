What is Lexia Reading?
======================

Lexia provides explicit, systematic, personalized learning on foundational reading skills for students of all abilities, and delivers norm-referenced performance data and analysis without interrupting the flow of instruction to administer a test. This research-proven, technology-based approach accelerates reading skills development, predicts studentsâ€™ year-end performance and provides teachers data-driven action plans to help differentiate instruction. [1]_

Lexia Strategies for Older Students is designed for remedial students in grades 6 and above, at a Tier II and Tier III level. The program focuses on foundational reading skills, starting at first grade skill levels, with a more mature, age-appropriate interface and a range of content. [2]_
